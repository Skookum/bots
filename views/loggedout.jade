    p SDW Bot-Wars is an artificial intelligence challenge. Tournaments consist of a series of 1v1 games between bots submitted by users. These games are played on a grid, where each bot has control over a group of colored units. Bots move their units in each turn, with the goal being to eliminate all opposing units. To be successful, bots will need to use a combination of strategy and tactical learning.
